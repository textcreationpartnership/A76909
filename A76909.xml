         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Hee gathered all his Companies together in the woods, and as the <hi>Red≈øhanks</hi> entred into one place, they i≈ø≈øued out into another, and having an Army of about 15 thou≈øand, divided them into foure parts, and ≈øo whil≈øt one part was re≈øi≈øted, th' other were doring mi≈øchiefe: their ayme hath alwayes bin at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction of the County of <hi>Monno,</hi> there have they depopulated the Inhabitants, and de≈øtroyad fifteene Townes and three Ca≈øtles by fire, the Prote≈øtants which have bin taken there, have bin put to unheard of torments, women have bin ≈ølain in their husbands armes, and husbands embracing of their wives, the braines of children they daily da≈øh out, and in a mo≈øt damnable manner trample them under their feet, &amp;

And then doe they beare them up towards the Heavens, as if the King thereof would accept them as plea≈øing Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>But oh! Now mu≈øt I come to relate the bloudie≈øt Tragedy that ever eye beheld.</p>
            <p>Upon the 22. of <hi>Novemb;</hi> the Rebels made a privy ≈øearch in the City of <hi>Armagh,</hi> that they might in a moment de≈øtroy all tho≈øe which were true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtants there.</p>
            <p>And in the fir≈øt place, they be≈øet the hou≈øe of Sir <hi>Patrick Dun≈øon,</hi> who was alwayes knowne to bee an upright man, and a wor≈øhipper of the living God.</p>
            <p>This Sir <hi>Patricke Dun≈øon</hi> perceiving how his hou≈øe was ≈øurrounded, and knowing what would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently in≈øue, called all his ≈øervants to prayers, the Rebels in the meane while being in number about five hundred, broke downe the Gate, which led unth his hou≈øe, and as the ≈øaid Knight was making his ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the Almighty God, they ≈øeazed upon him, his wife, children, ≈øervants, and goods, asking Sir <hi>Patrick</hi> if he would doe as they did. el≈øe ≈øhould he be ≈øure to dye, who an≈øwered them thus.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>I had rather be a Doore-keeper in the hou≈øe of my God, then to live in the riche≈øt tents of the wicked.</hi>
            </q>
            <pb facs="tcp:153428:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Which when the Rebels heard, they took his wife and ravi≈øhed her, perforce, before his face, ≈ølew his ≈øervants, ≈øpurned his children untill they dyed, and then ≈øwore to doe the like to his wife, if that ≈øpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be would not recant his former words: but hee laughed them to ≈øcorne, ≈øaying, that their cruelty would be the meanes to bring them to eternall feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
            <p>When they perceived, how he had derided their proffer, they did run upon him, and bound him with rowles of match fa≈øt to a board, ≈øo fa≈øt, that his eyes bur≈øted out of his head, then did they cut of his eares, then his no≈øe, then ≈øeered off both his cheekes; after that they cut off his armes, after that his legs, and yet (a wonderfull thing to heare) was not this good Knight dead, although he were in body ≈øo inhuman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mangled: will, eye and vitall ≈øpirits remaine; then did they cut out his tongue, and afterward to put him out of his paine, they ran a red hot Iron into his bowels, and ≈øo he dyed.</p>
            <p>His Lady they killed not; but becau≈øe ≈øhe was a faire woman, did intend to keep her, that they might abu≈øe her delicate body when they plea≈øed: but God which bringeth all things to light, revenged the cau≈øe of this good Lady thus.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> having intelligence, how that the Rebels were in the city of <hi>Armagh,</hi> with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand men marched to the Prote≈øtants re≈øcue, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king downe the City gates, which were barred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him: which the <hi>Rebels</hi> hearing, prepared them ≈øelves for fight, but before they would ≈øetle their
<pb facs="tcp:153428:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>ranks, and foyles, they were all ≈øurprized by Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Moore,</hi> and many of them were ≈ølaine, and the Lady redeemed; whom Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> carryed home to his owne hou≈øe.</p>
            <p>But yet doe the <hi>Rebels</hi> commit very much ≈ølaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both by fire and ≈øword: no ≈øooner are they dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of one place, but they ari≈øe in another.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let us all with an unanimous con≈øent pray unto God, that he would be plea≈øed to weaken their enemies, and confound their foes, that the pure milke of the Go≈øpell may have its free pa≈ø≈øage among≈øt them: to which, let all true Prote≈øtants ≈øay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
